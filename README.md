# USBikeShareDataAnalysis
## Overview
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of bike share data using Python and a range of libraries and modules including CSV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datetime, Numpy, and Pandas. The objective was to gain valuable insights into the bike rental system's operations, subscriber behaviors, and ride patterns to optimize revenue and resource allocation.

## Key Highlights
### Data Cleaning and Extraction: 
We conducted a thorough data cleaning and extraction process on a sizable dataset comprising 420,000 records from bicycle rental systems across multiple cities.

### Subscriber Trip Rate: 
Through data analysis, we unveiled an impressive 85% subscriber trip rate, indicating a strong and loyal customer base.

### Identifying Overcharging: 
We identified instances of overcharging for rides exceeding a specified duration, primarily occurring between 6 AM and 5 PM. Overcharging percentages ranged from 3% to 11%, highlighting areas for potential improvement.

### Revenue Optimization: 
Our analysis provided valuable insights crucial for optimizing revenue and resource allocation within the bike share system. This information offers a clear path to enhance the system's efficiency and profitability across multiple cities.
